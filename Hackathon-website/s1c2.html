<h2> You stick your left hand out and hit a wall. You wince in pain because of the impact. You touch the wall again. You can feel the bricks on the wall. They are cold. You turn around and slowly walk forward, careful to avoid any walls. After about 10 steps, your leg bumps something. The second your leg touched the object, it started to glow. The faint light allowed you to see one thing: the glowing chest. </h4>
